## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(mdsr)
library(RMySQL)
db <- dbConnect_scidb(dbname = "imdb")

western <- "SELECT t.id, t.title, t.production_year,mi1.info AS genres
FROM title t
JOIN movie_info AS mi1 ON mi1.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id = 1
AND mi1.info_type_id = 3
AND info = 'Western';
"
data <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery(western)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
